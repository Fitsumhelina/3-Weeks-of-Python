'''     Python has two primitive loop commands:

                    while loops
                    for loops'''
                    
'''A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, 
    a dictionary, a set, or a string).This is less like the for keyword in other programming 
    languages, and works more like an iterator method asfound in other object-orientated programming languages.
    With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
'''


# for + our_variable + in +  our_range  + :  
#it wiil nor include the second number  eg.(1,10)   it will iterate from 1-9
#     statment
    
'''
Print each fruit in a fruit list:'''

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#   print(x)
'''
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":'''

# for x in "banana":
#   print(x)

'''looping from 1-100 numbers'''
pass

'''
            while loop'''

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   i += 1

'''Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.

'''


'''The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

'''


# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   if i == 3:
#     break
#   i += 1    #Exit the loop when i is 3:


'''The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:'''



# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#   i += 1
#   if i == 3:
#     continue
#   print(i)   #Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
