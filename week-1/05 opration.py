'''Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators'''

'''  Arithmetic operators

+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y'''

#example code 


''''   Assignment Operators

=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3'''

#example code 

''' Comparison Operators

==	Equal	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y'''

#example code 


''' Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

        - and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
        - or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
        - not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)'''
        
#example code 


# print (2+5*6/2)   #  what is the answer? ??

'''
The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

Operator	Description	Try it
()	Parentheses	
**	Exponentiation	
+x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
*  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
+  -	Addition and subtraction	
<<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
&	Bitwise AND	
^	Bitwise XOR	
|	Bitwise OR	
==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
not	Logical NOT	
and	AND	
or	OR'''
