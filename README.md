# Python Fundamentals Class for Techtonic Tribe - April 2024

Welcome to the repository for the **Python Fundamentals Class** for Techtonic Tribe's second cohort, held in April 2024. This course is designed to provide beginners with a strong foundation in Python programming, covering essential concepts and practical exercises.

## Contents

This repository contains code examples and exercises that cover the following topics:

1. **Variables**  
2. **Syntax**  
3. **Strings**  
4. **If-Else Statements**  
5. **Data Types**  
6. **Loops**  
7. **Dictionaries**  
8. **Lists**  
9. **Tuples**  
10. **Sets**  
11. **Additional Basic Concepts**  

## What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

### It is used for:

- **Web development (server-side)**  
- **Software development**  
- **Mathematics**  
- **System scripting**

## What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.  
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.  
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.  
- Python can handle big data and perform complex mathematics.  
- Python is excellent for rapid prototyping or production-ready software development.

---

## Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).  
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.  
- Pythonâ€™s syntax allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.  
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning code can be executed as soon as it is written. This enables quick prototyping.  
- Python can be treated in a **procedural**, **object-oriented**, or **functional** way.

## Good to Know

- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which will be used in this course. While Python 2 is still popular, it only receives security updates and is no longer actively developed.  
- In this tutorial, Python will be written in a text editor. However, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as **Thonny**, **PyCharm**, **NetBeans**, or **Eclipse** can be used for managing larger projects.  
- **Python Syntax vs. Other Programming Languages**:  
  - Python was designed for readability and has similarities to the English language, influenced by mathematics.  
  - Python uses **new lines** to complete a command, unlike many other programming languages that use semicolons or parentheses.  
  - Python relies on **indentation (whitespace)** to define scope, such as loops, functions, and classes. Other languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.
